    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>A crispy, inside-out Parmesan omelet.</p>
    <p>caramelized cheese form a thin but protective layer</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>Â¼ teaspoon water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>8-inch non-stick skillet</li>
      <li>
        1 ounce freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or a little less
      </li>
      <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crack eggs into a mixing bowl. Add 1/4 teaspoon water. Whisk together
        until just beaten (do not overmix).
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle olive oil into 8-inch nonstick skillet. Brush evenly over the
        bottom of the pan. Evenly grate cheese into the skillet approximately
        1/2-inch deep (or just shy of 1 ounce).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place pan over medium-high heat. Cheese will slowly start to melt. When
        cheese starts to bubble and turn golden brown, about 4 minutes, pour
        eggs evenly over cheese. Reduce heat to low. Sprinkle with salt, pepper,
        and cayenne. Cover and let eggs cook on low until they are set, checking
        after the first 30 seconds. For 2 eggs, this should take about 1 minute,
        total cooking time. Remove pan from heat. Carefully use a spatula to
        fold "parmalet" in half. Transfer to serving plate.
