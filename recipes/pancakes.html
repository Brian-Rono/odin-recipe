    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      A great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the
      weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
        Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter;
        mix until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour
        or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for
        each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
